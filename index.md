## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
[How llms learn in context in 1 foward pass]

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
[Probably how to apply this to a smaller llm and create a resource like a Rag application capable of using context from multiple sources]

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
[Probably meet with my group more and try to learn more of the math used in llms]

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
[I think I should learn web development skills for the second quarter project]
